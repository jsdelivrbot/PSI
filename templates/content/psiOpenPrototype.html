The following demonstrates a tool that helps data depositors release privacy preserving statistics describing a dataset, by distributing a privacy budget across different possible statistical calculations. This tool is called the <i>budgeter</i>.  Users select which statistics they would like to calculate and are given estimates of how accurately each statistic can be computed. They can also redistribute their privacy budget according to which statistics they think are most valuable in their dataset.

You can bring up an explanatory page at any point, by clicking any of the information buttons, marked <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-question-sign" style="color:#A3CEDC;font-size: 12px;"></span>.

This prototype is for demonstrating our tool to new users, so we do not expect you to have knowledge of any exemplar datasets being employed.  If you were an actual researcher depositing your own data, first we would ask you to affirm some characteristics of your data and set some privacy parameters.  You can see these steps on the next page, or skip to the prototype.
